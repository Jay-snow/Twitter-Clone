# Poke-Tweet

A twitter-clone implemented with HTML, CSS, PHP, and mySQL. This project was my way of dipping my toes into the backend.

## Motivation

Poke-Tweet is a personal project created by Marcus Snow to learn the fundamentals of backend programming. The main goal of this project was to get familiar with PHP and mySQL.

Here are some of the concepts I learned while writing this program:

**Authentication** - logging in, logging out, and user-based permissions for editing profiles.

**Security** - salting and hashing passwords and escaping user-input before going into the database.

**Validation** - Forms must meet certain requirements before being submitted (can't be blank, must have a certain character limit, etc)

**Database Management** - How to setup a database offline and online

**Sessions** - How to handle sessions for users
